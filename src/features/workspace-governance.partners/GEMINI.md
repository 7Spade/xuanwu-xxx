# Feature Slice: `workspace-governance.partners`

## Domain

Workspace-level partner relationship management (stub — workspace-specific partner access rules).

> **Note**: Org-level partner management views (`PartnersView`, `PartnerDetailView`) were migrated to
> `account-organization.partner` per `logic-overview.v3.md` (partners are SUBJECT CENTER, not WORKSPACE CONTAINER).
> This slice is reserved for future workspace-scoped partner access rules.

## Public API (`index.ts`)

```ts
// Stub — no exports until workspace-level partner access rules are implemented
```
