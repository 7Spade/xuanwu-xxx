# Feature Slice: `workspace-governance.schedule`

## Domain

**Stub — implementation migrated to `workspace-business.schedule`.**

Per `logic-overview.v3.md`: `W_B_SCHEDULE` is in `WORKSPACE_BUSINESS`; `WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE` only contains `members` and `role`. This slice is reserved for future workspace-scoped schedule governance rules (if needed), but currently holds no active code.

## Public API (`index.ts`)

```ts
// Stub — no exports
```
