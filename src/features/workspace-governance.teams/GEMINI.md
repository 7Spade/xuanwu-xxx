# Feature Slice: `workspace-governance.teams`

## Domain

Workspace-level team structure management (stub — workspace-specific team access rules).

> **Note**: Org-level team management views (`TeamsView`, `TeamDetailView`) were migrated to
> `account-organization.team` per `logic-overview.v3.md` (teams are SUBJECT CENTER, not WORKSPACE CONTAINER).
> This slice is reserved for future workspace-scoped team access rules.

## Public API (`index.ts`)

```ts
// Stub — no exports until workspace-level team access rules are implemented
```
